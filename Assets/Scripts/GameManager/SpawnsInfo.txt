# ENEMYTYPES: DEFAULT, BIG
# Format is in: 'EnemyType:Amount'
# Include the Level before it with the Format: '---- Level ----'
# The number for the level doesn't mean anything
# It's just to give an indication to the us what the level actually is
# The ----, however, is necessary to keep track of the Levels

# Default spawnTimes are: (Noted as in, spawn every # seconds)
# DEFAULT: 3
# BIG: 10
# If you want to change the spawn time for a current level, then
# Use the Format: 'EnemyType:Amount:SpawnTime'
# Otherwise, it will use the previously used SpawnTime
# SpawnTime must be an integer

# There can be spaces between the numbers and the EnemyType
